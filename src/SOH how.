Internal Resistance (Rint) - Core Concept
What is Rint?
Internal resistance is the opposition to current flow inside the battery itself. Every battery has internal components (electrodes, electrolyte, connections) that resist current, causing voltage drops under load.

Physical Analogy:
Think of a battery as a perfect voltage source with a small resistor in series:

The Key Relationship: Ohm's Law
When current flows, voltage drops across the internal resistance:

How Your Monitor Measures It (ΔV/ΔI Method):

Before step: Measure stable V₁ and I₁ (e.g., 12.6V, 0A)
After step: Measure stable V₂ and I₂ (e.g., 12.44V, 4A)
Calculate: Rint = (V₂ - V₁) / (I₂ - I₁) = -0.16V / 4A = 40mΩ
Why Rint Matters - State of Health (SOH):

Fresh battery (healthy):

Low Rint (~30-35mΩ for LTX9-4)
Small voltage drop under load
Good performance
Aged/degraded battery:

High Rint (~70-100mΩ)
Large voltage drop under load
Poor cranking ability, reduced capacity
SOH Calculation:

Temperature Effect:
Battery resistance increases in cold weather. Your monitor compensates by normalizing to 25°C:

Why the Learner?
The baseline (35mΩ) might not match your specific battery. The learner:

Observes many load steps over time
Identifies the lowest stable Rint (= healthy baseline)
Updates baseline gradually (10+ minutes of data)
Provides accurate SOH for your battery
What Increases Rint?

Sulfation (lead-acid batteries)
Corrosion on plates
Electrolyte degradation
Active material loss
Age and cycle count
Monitoring Rint trends over weeks/months predicts when replacement is needed before the battery fails unexpectedly.
